# Quiz Application

A simple quiz application built with React. This app allows users to take a quiz, answer questions, and view their results. The questions are fetched from an API, and the answers are submitted to the backend for evaluation. The app includes functionality for starting the quiz, navigating between questions, and retaking the quiz.

## Features

- **Start Quiz**: Begin the quiz by clicking the "Start Quiz" button.
- **Navigation**: Navigate between questions using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
- **Submit Quiz**: Submit the quiz to view the results.
- **View Results**: After submitting, see your score along with the correct answers and your answers.
- **Retake Quiz**: Option to retake the quiz after viewing the results.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the application.

- **Django (Backend)**: The backend API (assumed to be Django) serves quiz questions and handles submission of answers.
